***Beware that there is a bug with the CourseButton Script, Don't worry about it and continue with what we took and we'll see how we can fix it.***

On this lecture we began our first full game created with the Unity Engine.

It will be a simple platformer where you're able to move horizontally, jump, collect coins, and avoid obstacles. Your goal is to reach an end point.

In this lecture we were able to create:
- Player movement and simple graphics.
- Simple Obstacles.
- Finish Point.
- Simple Finish Screen.
- Player Death.
- Mobile Controls.

What remains:
- Main Menu.
- Coins.
- Obstacle Variations.
- Score System
- Multiple Levels
